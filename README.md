# Y3-Deep-Learning
Year 3 Semester 2 module to explore deep learning methods and how to improve results through fine tuning.

The main structure of this module involved the comparison of two seperate deep learning models of our choosing. I chose to compare one well known model with a model of my own creation to better explore the impact of different changes to hyperparameters.

The language used for this module is Python, and I recieved a 1st for it.
